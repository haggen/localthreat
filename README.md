## About

**[localthreat](https://localthreat.xyz/)** is an online tool to help EVE players with threat assessment.

## Contribution

I accept **ISK donations** as contributions to the project. If you feel like localthreat has helped you please consider contributing. Send a donation in-game of any value to **Jason Chorant**. This helps to keep me motivated and also with the costs of running and maintaining this service.

## Development

- üë®‚Äçüíª The code and documentation are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/haggen/localthreat).
- üé® The design lives on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/BPH2xeVvbBDAnWpjMI58GpnW/localthreat.next?node-id=0%3A1).
- üêõ Bug tracking, feature requests, and other feedback must be made on the [repository's issues page](https://github.com/haggen/localthreat/issues/new/choose).

### Docker setup (recommended)

With [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed , run:

```shell
docker compose up
```

This will boot everything you need in one go. Pass `-d` to free your terminal (daemon mode). You can resume your work later with the same command.

If it's your first run though, you'll need to create the database schema. Once the containers are up, run:

```shell
docker compose exec -Tu postgres db psql < api/schema.sql
```

You can access the application at http://client-localthreat.local.crz.li and the API at http://api-localthreat.local.crz.li.

> üí° local.crz.li is a public wildcard loopback domain. It resolves to `127.0.0.1` or `::1` in IPv6.

### Manual setup

If you don't have Docker or don't want to deal with it you can build and run everything locally.

#### API

It's a simple web server written in Go that talks JSON.

You'll need Go 1.15+ installed. Hop into the `api/` sub-directory and run:

```shell
go get
```

To download all the dependencies and then:

```shell
make
```

To test and build the binary.

You'll also need PostgreSQL 12+ running. Load `api/schema.sql` file into your database and run:

```shell
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres@localhost/postgres PORT=5000 ./api
```

This will start the API server. You might want to adjust the `DATABASE_URL` and `PORT` values accordingly.

#### Client

It's a [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) written in TypeScript.

You'll need Node 12+ and npm installed. Hop into the `client/` sub-directory and run:

```shell
npm install
```

To download all the dependencies and then:

```shell
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000 npm run-script start
```

To start the development server. You might want to adjust the `REACT_APP_API_URL` value accordingly.
