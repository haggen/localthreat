          It's a website that helps players of EVE Online quickly identify
          friend from foe and assess the level of threat their enemies may

          With the window in focus, it listens for paste events from the user.
          You'll need to copy a chat transcript or a channel member list from
          in-game and press <code>CTRL-V</code> on this page. localthreat will
          then parse the pasted content, looking for character names, and query
          more information from official and third-party services, to offer a
          complete report of affiliations and PvP statistics for those players.
