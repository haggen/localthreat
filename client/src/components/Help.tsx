          friends from foes and assess the level of threat their enemies may

          With the window in focus, localthreat listens for paste events from
          the user. Copy a chat transcript or a channel member list from
          in-game, then press <code>CTRL-V</code> on this page. localthreat will
          then parse the pasted content, look for character names, and query
          more information from official and third-party services to offer a
          complete report of affiliations and PvP statistics for those players.
